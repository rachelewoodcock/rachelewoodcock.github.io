	<h3> RESOURCES </h3>

	<div class="rectangle-body"> The preparation of a relatively straight forward last will and testament, together with power of attorney, usually involves the collecting of information about your last wishes after you have first read the background Client Information Package. Please see our contact page to request this package.

	Likewise, other requests for resources can be made in the same manner.

	<br>
	<br>

	Thank you.
